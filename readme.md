# 📔-About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in Node.js!

Using an already functional application as a base, document the routes with Swagger.

## 📚-API Routes

### 📌 POST `/users`

The route must receive `name` and `email` inside the request body to be able to create an user.


### 📌 PATCH `/users/:user_id/admin`

The route must receive, in the request params, the user `id` and exchange this user to admin.

### 📌 GET `/users/:user_id`

The route must receive, in the request params, the user `id` and return the user's info found by the response body.

### 📌 GET `/users`

The route must receive, in the request header, a properties `user_id` with the user `id` and return a list with all users created.

The `id` must be used to validate if the user who is requesting the list is an admin. The list response only must be done if the user is an admin.

# ✴️-Tests Specification 

## 📚-Model Test

### 📌 Should be able to create an user with all props

For this test, you must create a model with the properties below:
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "admin": "boolean",
  "email": "string",
  "created_at": "Date",
  "updated_at": "Date",
}
```
The `admin` property should be started with `false` and the `id` should be automatically generated as `uuid`.

## 📚-Repository Tests
### 📌 Should be able to create new users

For this test, the `create` method of UsersRepository file needs to receive the user's name and email to create an user from the model.

### 📌 Should be able to list all users

For this test, the `list` method of UsersRepository file return a list of all created users.

### 📌 Should be able to find user by ID

For this test, the `findById` method of UsersRepository file must receive the user `id` and return an user who has the same `id`.

### 📌 Should be able to find user by e-mail address

For this test, the `findByEmail` method of UsersRepository file must receive the user `email` and return the user who has the same `email`.

### 📌 Should be able to turn an user as admin

For this test, the `turnAdmin` method of UsersRepository must receive the whole user object, change the `admin` property to `true`, update the `updated_at` property and return the updated user.

## 📚-UseCases Tests

### 📌 Should be able to create new users

For this test, the `execute` method of CreateUserUseCase file must receive the user `name` and `email` to be created, create an user through the repository's create method and return the created user.

### 📌 Should not be able to create new users when email is already taken

For this test, the `execute` method of CreateUserUseCase file must not allow an user to be created if exist an user with the same `email`.

If exist an user with the same email return the error message:
```tsx
throw new Error("Mensagem do erro");
```

### 📌 Should be able to turn an user as admin

For this test, the `execute` method of TurnUserAdminUseCase file must receive the user `id`, call the repository method wich change the user to `admin` and return the user after the change.

### 📌 Should not be able to turn a non existing user as admin

For this test, the `execute` method of TurnUserAdminUseCase file must not allow an `user` who does not exist to be changed in `admin`.

If the user does not exist return the error message:
```tsx
throw new Error("Mensagem do erro");
```
### 📌 Should be able to get user profile by ID

For this test, the `execute` method of ShowUserProfileUseCase file must receive the user `id`, call the repository's method wich search an user by `id` and return the user found.

### 📌 Should not be able to show profile of a non existing user

For this test, the `execute` method of ShowUserProfileUseCase file must not allow a non-existing user to be return.

If the user does not exist return the error message:
```tsx
throw new Error("Mensagem do erro");
```
### 📌 Should be able to list all users

For this test, the `execute` method of ListAllUsersUseCase file must receive the user `id`, call the repository's method which return all created users and return this info.

### 📌 Should not be able to a non admin user get list of all users

For this test, the `execute` method of ListAllUsersUseCase must not allow an user who is not a `admin` access the created users.

If the user is not an `admin`, return a message error:
```tsx
throw new Error("Mensagem do erro");
```
### 📌 Should not be able to a non existing user get list of all users

For this test, the `execute` method of ListAllUsersUse Case file must not allow an user does not exist, access the created users list.

If the user does not exist, return a message error:
```tsx
throw new Error("Mensagem do erro");
```

## 📚 Routes Tests

## 📝 Route - [POST] /users
### 📌 Should be able to create new users

For this test, using the proper useCase, the route must create an `user` and return a status `201` with the created user object.

### 📌 Should not be able to create new users when email is already taken

For this test, if an error has occurred in useCase, return a response with status `400` and a json with an object `{ error: "error message" }`, where the value of the `error` property should be the message thrown by the error in useCase.

To catch errors thrown by other files, you can wrap the contents of the controller in a `try/catch`.

## 📝 Rota - [PATCH] /users/:user_id/admin
### 📌 Should be able to turn an user as admin

For this test, using the proper useCase, the route must change an user to `admin` and return the user changed int the response body.

### 📌 Should not be able to turn a non existing user as admin

For this test, if an error has occurred in useCase, return a response with status `404` and a json with an object `{ error: "error message" }`, where the value of the `error` property should be the message thrown by the error in useCase.

## 📝 Rota - [GET] /users/:user_id
### 📌 Should be able to get user profile by ID

For this test, using the proper useCase, the route must receive the user `id` by route params and return the founded user object in the response body.

### 📌 Should not be able to show profile of a non existing user

For this test, if an error has occurred in useCase, return a response with status `404` and a json with an object `{ error: "error message" }`, where the value of the `error` property should be the message thrown by the error in useCase.

## 📝 Rota - [GET] /users
### 📌 Should be able to list all users

For this test, using the proper useCase, the route must receive the `admin` user `id` from `user_id` request header and return a user list created.

### 📌 Should not be able to a non admin user get list of all users and Should not be able to a non existing user get list of all users

For these tests, if an error has occurred in useCase, return a response with status `400` and a json with an object `{ error: "error message" }`, where the value of the `error` property should be the message thrown by the error in useCase.

# ⁉️ The extra mile

Implementation of extra features.

## 📚 Should not be able to create new users without an email or name

For this test, the `execute` method of CreateUserUseCase file must not allow an user to be created if the field `email` or `name` is empty.
